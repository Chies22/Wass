<!--some code--><p>Lions are highly adaptable and can live in very dry areas like the Kalahari Desert. Here they get most of their water from their prey and will even drink from plants such as the Tsamma melon. </p>
    <h3>7. Lions are big eaters</h3>
    <p>Lions can eat up to 40kg of meat in a single meal - around a quarter of their body weight.Their tongues have sharp-pointed rasps, called papillae, which are used to scrape meat off the bones. </p>
    <h3>8. They hunt during storms </h3>
    <p>Lions do most of their hunting at night as their eyes have adapted to the dark and this gives them a huge advantage over their prey.Interestingly though, lions also hunt during storms. The noise, rain and/or wind make it harder for prey to see and hear them, increasing their chances of a successful hunt.When hunting, lionesses have specific roles. Some play the role of 'centre' and others the role of 'wing' - the wings chase the prey towards the centres.</p>
    <h3>9. Lions are the only cats who roar together</h3>
    <p>Lions are the only known cat species where individuals roar together - with even young cubs joining in with their mews. The calling sequence usually lasts about 40 seconds.A group of lions, also called 'a pride', often roar together to mark their territory - a roar can be heard from 5 miles away. </p>
    <h3>10. Lions are not as many as you would think</h3>
    <p>There are thought to be as few as 23,000 lions left in the wild. When you think there are around 415,000 wild African elephants, you realise lion numbers are incredibly low.In fact, lions have disappeared from over 90% of their historical range.</p>
