    <h3 style="text-align: center;color: brown; text-decoration:underline; text-transform: uppercase;"> 1. Nearly all wild lions live in Africa, but one small population exists elsewhere</h3>
    <p> In the wild, there are two formally recognised lion subspecies.The African lion (Panthera leo leo) is found in Africa, south of the Sahara desert. The Asiatic lion (Panthera leo persica) exists in one small population around Gir Forest National Park in western India. Wild lions in the west and central Africa are more closely related to these Asiatic lions in India than to those found in southern and east Africa.</p>
   <h3>2.Male lions can weigh 30 stone</h3>
   <p><b>On average, male lions weigh 190kg (almost 30 stone) and females weigh 126kg (almost 20 stone).They need this weight and power behind them to hunt large prey and defend their pride.</b></p>
   <h3>3. They start off spotty</h3>
   <p>Young lions have rosettes and spots on their sandy coats, but these generally disappear as they mature. </p>
   <h3>4. The magnificent manes on male lions tell a story</h3>
   <p>Most male lions grow impressive manes the older they get.<i>These manes grow up to 16cm long and are a sign of dominance.However, not all male lions have manes. <em>Maneless</em> male lions are common in parts of Africa, such as Tsavo National Park in Kenya. This is thought to be an adaptation to the local climate, as manes can reduce heat loss.</i> </p>
    <h3>5. Lion cubs are reared together</h3>
    <p>A pride of lions is usually made up of related females and their cubs, plus a male or small group of males who defend their pride. The lionesses rear their cubs together and cubs can suckle from any female with milk. </p>
